OTP Validation Project
This is my first mini JavaScript project: an OTP (One-Time Password) validation system. The project dynamically generates a new OTP every 15 seconds, and users can
validate their entered OTP to check if it is correct and within the validity period.

Features
Generates a 4-digit OTP every 15 seconds.
Provides user input for OTP validation.
Displays a success message if the OTP is valid and matches.
Displays an error message for invalid or expired OTP.
Simple and interactive UI using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technologies Used
HTML5: To structure the user interface.
CSS3: For styling the components.
JavaScript: To handle OTP generation, validation, and timer logic.
